Spectre is a versatile tool used for analysis of MALDI-MSI data sets.

In order to build and run the application, please refer to the
[installation](#install) section.

## About

This is a desktop client for the Divisive IK-means algorithm for unsupervised
segmentation, which can be used for efficient dataset compression, as
well as knowledge discovery. It has already been published and
referring links have been enclosed under the [references](#references) section.

## Install

Please refer to [this manual](docs/Spectre.DivikWpfClient.pdf), as MATLAB
Common Runtime has to be installed.

## Exemplary usage

Please refer to [docs](docs/Spectre.DivikWpfClient.pdf).

## How to contribute?

Please contact us by [e-mail](mailto:Grzegorz.Mrukwa@polsl.pl). We will answer
you in details.

Short contribution guide is actively constructed on
[the project's wiki](https://github.com/spectre-team/spectre/wiki)
as the development progresses.

## Environment

Please refer to [the docs](docs/Spectre.DivikWpfClient.pdf).
